This project focuses on Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition, aiming to develop a system capable of accurately identifying and translating TSL gestures into text and speech in real-time. This innovative solution addresses communication barriers faced by hearing-impaired individuals, leveraging machine vision and deep learning technologies to contribute to inclusive and accessible communication tools. The project specifically targets the recognition of the TSL alphabet, translating hand gestures into corresponding letters to build a foundation for future expansions into words and sentences.
